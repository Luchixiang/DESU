### Introduction
This repository hosts the version of the code used for the **[publication](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12291)** **Fully Unsupervised Probabilistic Noise2Void** (accepted at IEEE Symposium for Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020). For a short summary of the main attributes of the publication, please check out the **[project webpage](https://juglab.github.io/PPN2V)**. 

We refer to the techniques elaborated in the publication, here as **PPN2V**, which stands for **`Parametric Probabilistic Noise2Void`**. `PPN2V` extends the formulation of Probabilistic Noise2Void (`PN2V`), the corresponding publication for which is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.00651). 

As a recap, in addition to noisy images, `PN2V` requires a noise model to be included during the training (and inference) of the network. This noise model is extracted from calibration data and is represented as a normalized, two-dimensional histogram. 

The contributions of this publication are two-fold: In `PPN2V`, we provide an alternate representation of the noise model, by parameterizing it as a Gaussian Mixture Model. This scheme, referred to as **`PN2V GMM`** in the publication, improves results over `PN2V` in two of the three datasets and is more robust to the quantity of the calibration data used and to the range of intensities available in the calibration data.

We next explored the question of avoiding using any calibration data and to go **fully unsupervised**. Such schemes, referred to as **`Boot GMM`** and **`Boot Hist`** (which stand for `Bootstrapped GMM` and `Bootstraped Histogram` respectively) in the publication, improve results over `PN2V`. Just to re-iterate, `Boot GMM` and `Boot Hist` <ins>only require</ins> noisy images during training (and inference) of the network.

We hope to soon merge this repository with the existing repository for `PN2V`, which is currently available [here](https://github.com/juglab/PN2V).

### Dependencies 
We have tested this implementation using `pytorch` version 1.1.0 and `cudatoolkit` version 9.0. 

In order to replicate results mentioned in the publication, one could use the same virtual environment (`ppn2vEnvironment.yml`) as used by us. Create a new environment, for example,  by entering the python command in the terminal `conda env create -f path/to/ppn2vEnvironment.yml`.

### Getting Started
Look in the `examples` directory and try out one (or all) of the three sets of notebooks (`Convallaria`, `MouseSkullNuclei` or `MouseActin`). Prior to beginning the denoising pipeline, decide which mode one would like to operate in : (i) using **Calibration** Data (the noise model is estimated from additional, static noisy images). (ii) **Bootstrap** (the noise model is estimated directly from the single, noisy image of interest). This would determine the notebooks needed to be executed in sequence.
